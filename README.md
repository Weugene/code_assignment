# Coding and Auto-Grading Plugin for WordPress
## Problem
When setting up an online school for children, we faced a challenge finding a WordPress plugin that allowed students to code in Python with proper syntax highlighting and receive automated grading. The existing options were either poorly formatted and impractical or cost over $100 per monthâ€”an unaffordable option for our newly established school.

## Solution
To address this, I developed a custom WordPress plugin that integrates an easy-to-use Python IDE with an auto-grader. This plugin is designed to meet both teacher and student needs:

### Teacher Panel:
- Define problem sets.
- Specify correct answers and create test cases.
- Provide sample teacher code for guidance.

### Student Panel:
- Interactive Python IDE (powered by Trinket) with syntax highlighting and a smooth coding experience.
- Problem description display alongside the IDE.
- Code submission with automatic grading and feedback.


## Acknowledgment
Special thanks to the [Trinket platform](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/create?lang=python3) for providing an excellent IDE foundation that seamlessly integrates with the plugin.

This plugin offers an affordable, user-friendly solution for coding education, making it easier for schools and teachers to provide interactive learning experiences.
